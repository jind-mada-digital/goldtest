<p>What happens to Goldtest clothing once it has been used?</p>

<p>In association with the Association for the Respect and Dignity of the Himalayan Bearers, Goldtest provides the outfits. This association rents out the outfits, so that people can rent them for their guide. A way to recycle our outfits while doing a service.Â </p>
